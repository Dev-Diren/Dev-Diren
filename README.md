**Dev-Diren/Dev-Diren** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Surviving. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Github, Python and Web stuff
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing for now
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with life
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the lucky number for the year
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: via email.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: im pro nouns, verbs can suckit
- âš¡ Fun fact: this is not a fun fact.
